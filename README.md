A basic, cross-platform weather application built with Flutter, designed to fetch and display real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API. This project serves as a practical demonstration of integrating external APIs and building a user interface in Flutter.

## Features

*   Display current weather conditions (temperature, weather description).
*   Fetches real-time data using the OpenWeather API.
*   Simple and intuitive user interface.
*   Cross-platform compatibility (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Flutter SDK**: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
*   **Dart SDK**: Included with Flutter SDK.
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nitinkoberoii/Weather-App-UI.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Weather-App-UI
    ```

3.  **Install Flutter dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

### API Key Setup

This application relies on the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. You need to obtain an API key from OpenWeather and configure it in your project.

1.  **Get an API Key:**
    *   Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/api).
    *   Sign up for a free account.
    *   Navigate to the "API keys" tab to find or generate your API key.

2.  **Create `secrets.dart`:**
    *   In the `lib` folder of your project, create a new file named `secrets.dart`.
    *   Add the following content to `lib/secrets.dart`, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual OpenWeather API key:

    ```dart
    // lib/secrets.dart
    const openWeatherAPIKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
    ```

    **Note:** It's crucial to keep your API key secret and avoid committing it directly to public repositories. The `.gitignore` file should ideally prevent `secrets.dart` from being tracked if it's properly configured.

## Usage

After completing the installation and API key setup, you can run the application on your preferred device or emulator.

To run the app:

```bash
flutter run
```

To run on a specific device (e.g., Chrome web browser, Android emulator, desktop):

```bash
# For web
flutter run -d chrome

# For Android emulator (replace 'emulator-5554' with your emulator ID)
flutter run -d emulator-5554

# For desktop (if enabled for your platform)
flutter run -d macos # or windows, linux
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Flutter application structure:
